# API-System
This is new API System using Perl/PHP.
Doesn't require ssh/ssh2.

Edit the server.pl to what you like then run on your attack servers with "screen perl server.pl"
Edit the client.pl line 3 add your server IPs then upload api.php/client.pl to your API server then you are done.

Thank you for your time
